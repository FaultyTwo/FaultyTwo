## :wave: Hi there.
Currently. I'm an Electronic Engineering graduate, wasted 5 months (May-Sep) looking for a job, beaten by the <b><i>harsh reality</i></b> of tech world.<br>
But I can't stop now, <b>can I?</b>

Primary Objective:
- [x] Wiping the tear out of my face. Get back on my feet.
- [x] Accept that you won't get a Software Engineer gig.
- [ ] Complete the DevOps course.
- [x] Get back to the world of Machine Learning. And finally heading in deep into its fray, non-stop.

Secondary Objective: 
- [ ] Looking for open source projects that I can contribute to.
- [ ] Beat the fear of public speaking.
- [ ] Face the actuality and the horror of JavaScript (plus, Node.JS to keep my sanity intact).
- [ ] Learn how to code in C# and Java properly again.
- [ ] Build an ASP.NET app using C#.

Tertiary Objective:
- [ ] Get a job in a good company.. well, we will see about that.
- [ ] Be happy for once.

Last Objective:
- [ ] Die (happily).

Well. Let's see if I will strive or starve to death before I get there or not.<br>
So much excitement!
