## :wave: Hi there.
Currently. I'm an Electronic Engineering graduate, wasted 5 months (May-Sep) looking for a job, beaten by the <b><i>harsh reality</i></b> of tech world.<br>
But I can't stop now, <b>can I?</b>

Primary Objective:
- [ ] Get a grip. Of anything, and everything.
- [ ] Fix the brain to go vroooooooooom again.

## :spiral_notepad: About me:
- :notes: Love listening to music (prefer chill genres, Vaporwave enthusiast) 
- :video_game: Like video games. But don't play them religiously as I used to.
- :open_book: Reading books.. should be everyone favorite activity.
- :fire: "I learn through suffering."
- :smoking: <i> "Life is like a game of poker. The rule is easy, but it's all luck and gamble." </i>
