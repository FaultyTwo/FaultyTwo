## :wave: Hi there.
Currently. I'm a junior software developer at a company. And... that's it. Nothing interesting has happened to me so far.<br>
Although. I'm looking to expand my knowledge's border.

Shall I dip even deeper than before? The answer should be obvious.

## :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Primary Objectives
- [ ] Cybersecurity
- [ ] Go .. it fried my brain when it comes to array declarations because its syntax is weird to say the least
- [ ] Rust (looking forward to)
- [ ] Artificial Intelligence (key papers)
- [ ] Finance .. gotta claim back what the education system stole
- [ ] Probably more I couldn't put my hands on for now

## :spiral_notepad: About me:
- :notes: Love listening to music (prefer chill genres, Vaporwave fanatic) 
- :video_game: Like video games. But don't play them religiously as I used to.
- :open_book: Reading books.. should be everyone favorite activity.
- :fire: "I learn through suffering."
- :bookmark_tabs: For now. I will fill you in later..
