## :wave: Hi there.
Currently. I'm a software developer at a company. And... that's it. Nothing interesting has happened to me so far.<br>
Although. I'm looking to expand my knowledge's border.

Shall I dip even deeper than before? The answer should be obvious.

## :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Primary Objectives
- [x] Go make awesome things again (In progress ...)

## :spiral_notepad: About me:
- :notes: Love listening to music (prefer chill genres, Vaporwave fanatic) 
- :video_game: Like video games. But don't play them religiously as I used to.
- :open_book: Reading books.. should be everyone favorite activity.
- :fire: "I learn through suffering."
- :bookmark_tabs: For now. I will fill you in later..
