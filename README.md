## :wave: Hi there.
Currently. I'm a software developer for a company. And ... that's it. Nothing interesting has happened to me so far.<br>
Although. I'm always looking to expand my borders. Getting too comfy means being rusty.

## :notebook_with_decorative_cover: What To Do
There is a lot to do. From learning this, documenting that, understand those, and applying these.<br>
I'm still at negative. I want to go back to <b>zero.</b>

## :spiral_notepad: About me:
- :notes: Love listening to music (prefer chill genres, a Vaporwave fanatic).
- :video_game: Like video games. But I don't play them religiously as I used to.
- :books: Reading. Books are great. But make sure to filter out bad ones.
- :cloud_with_lightning_and_rain: Anxious about my performance. It's hard to be good at something.
